# Data Visualization Project

## Project Description

This is a data visualization project where I will be working with a large data set of my own choice to conduct a thorough analysis. The main objective of this project is to enhance my code portfolio with a comprehensive Data Analysis & Visualization Project.

## Project Goals

Grow my autonomy in efficiently analyzing and visualizing big data sets using code.
Practice effective communication of the value of my analysis through storytelling.

## Project Requirements

To successfully complete this project, I need to fulfill the following requirements:

Choose a data set with a minimum of 10,000 rows and 10 columns and present it for approval.
Continuously use Trello Board for project management.
Conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) that includes:
A descriptive analysis of the data set.
A diagnostic analysis building upon the descriptive analysis.

## Technical Requirements

To meet the project goals and requirements, I will adhere to the following technical requirements:

Put the data into one or more Pandas DataFrames.
Clean the DataFrame(s) by handling missing values, removing duplicates, etc.
Slice the DataFrame(s) in interesting ways to extract relevant subsets.
Reshape the data using techniques such as groupby, unstack, pivot_table, etc., and perform necessary aggregate operations.
Create additional features/columns that provide valuable insights.
Utilize statistical tools in my analysis, including:
Understanding the nature of the data through classification.
Calculating correlations, standard deviations, etc.
Handling outliers using boxplots or other techniques.
Analyzing distribution types, etc.
Visualize my findings effectively using suitable visualization libraries and techniques.

## Presentation

I will deliver a presentation that lasts a maximum of 5 minutes. The presentation slides will include the following components (not necessarily in this order):

Clear description and visualization of the chosen data set.
Clear description of the question(s) I explored during the analysis.
Clear communication of the main findings, supported by visualizations.
Learnings, highlights, and areas for improvement identified during the project.
Utilize storytelling techniques, including the 5 stages of a story and other tips discussed, to maximize the impact of the presentation.
